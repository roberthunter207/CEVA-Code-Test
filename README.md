# Code-Test
They're are two solutions to the code test provided.
You can select the two different code samples by switching branches.

One utilising a recursive method to convert user-input integers into words, and another utilising the Humanizer library which performs the same task.
The Humanizer library is available as a nuget and is open sourced. The link for this library is https://github.com/Humanizr/Humanizer.
